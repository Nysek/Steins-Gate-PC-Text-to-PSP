As I left Radio Kaikan, everyone vanished before my eyes. I can't explain it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000812)
And it wasn't just the people on the street.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000822)
The people in the stores, gone. In the restaurants,<LINE>gone. Even cars vanished, drivers and all.
<END>

And it all happened in the blink of an eye.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000842)
Suddenly, an empty city spread before me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000852)----There is text here
I could still hear the music from the stores, but those catchy<LINE>melodies were the only sounds of life remaining.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000862)
Heat was rising from the aspahlt in waves, but I felt<LINE>only a cold chill down my spine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000872)
I just stood there, breathless, until├┤
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000882)
"What's wrong?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000892)
Mayuri's voice brought me back to reality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A2)
Mayuri hadn't disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000956)
She was there, looking at me with<LINE>questioning eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000966)
"E-everyone disappeared just now, right!?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000980)
"Huh?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000990)
"You saw it too, right!? Just now, before our very eyes!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A0)
Panic took hold as the enormity of what had just happened struck me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B0)
Unable to control myself, I grabbed Mayuri by her slender shoulders and shook her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A000)
"Did you see it, Mayuri!? You saw it, right!?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2A)
"Hmmm? Huhhhhh?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3A)
Mayuri's head flopped back and forth from my shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4A)
"IIIII diiiiiidn't seeeee anythiiiiing!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1C)
"You... didn't?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000082C)
I stopped shaking her and looked straight into her eyes
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000083C)
She returned my gaze with eyes clear as glass marbles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B56)
"You saw nothing? Nothing at all!? There were people here<LINE>a second ago, weren't there!?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B66)
"...There were?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B76)
"Even the store eomployees are gone! That's impossible by any measure!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B86)
"Of course they are..."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9A)
Her reply didn't make any sense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB4)
"It was like this when we got here. Oh, I know! You're seeing things, aren't you?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC8)
"I'm sure it's 'cause of the heat! Tutturu!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD8)
How could she laugh at a time like this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE8)
I always thought she was a bit strange, but maybe her brain is actually broken.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCC2)
I realized that she couldn't help me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD2)
With nowhere else to turn, I looked up at the bright blue sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE2)
There wasn't a cloud in sight. the scourching summersun<LINE>shone bright through the gas between Akiba's buildings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF2)
Naturally, my eyes drifted to the top floor of Radio Kaikan, where<LINE>I had been just a moment before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D02)
There it was. An enormous machine, like some kind of satellite,<LINE>embedded in the roof of the building where, not five minutes before, I<LINE>had found Makise Kurisu's body in a pool of blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE8)
What happened to her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF8)
Just before everyone disappeared, I could've sworn I heard an ambulance siren.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E02)
Makise Kurisu might still be in that dark, narrow passageway<LINE> -- cold, bloody, and alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E18)
The thought disturbed me, but the question at the forefront of my<LINE>mind was...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E28)
"...What the hell is that satellite doing there?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E38)
Right before doctor Nakacachi's presentation, the building shook<LINE>like a bomb had exploded. The roof door lock had been broken, and beyond<LINE>it someone had placed a satellite-like machine,<LINE>shrouded in smoke and glowing dust.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E48)
When I first saw it, the satellite was "one" the rooftop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EBC)
But that's not what I was seeing now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ECC)
This satellite had penetrated the top floor of the building,<LINE>obliterating the room where Doctor Nakabachi's press conference had been held.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDC)
It must have fallen out of orbit without burning up in the stmosphere, somehow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEEC)
I knew it was crazy, but what other explanation could there be?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EFC)
The real question was....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0C)
When did that happen?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1C)
"Mayuri, about that satellite..."
<END>
#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2C)
"Yup. What a surprise, huh?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3C)
"What do you mean? What was a surprise?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4C)
"It made a huge 'kaplow' sound!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F5C)
A huge 'kaplow'...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F5C)
It certainly did make a sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE2)
But I don't think it was 'kaplow!'
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FFC)
I'd say it was more like "Zzzzzznnnmmm."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100C)
"Did that satellite fall out of the sky?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101C)
"Did it? Do you think any aliens were on board?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102C)
"..."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103C)
Had I lost my mind?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104C)
What i had seen didn't match at all with what Mayuri was saying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105C)
Suddenly, nothing seemed real. Had I dreamt it all?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001076)
"Hey! You two!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001086)
just then, a uniformed policeman ran up to us, his expression stern.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001096)
"What do you think you're doing here?<LINE>This area is off-limits. You have to leave."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A6)
"We're sorry!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B6)
"First, my good man -- let's call you 'Officer A' -- <LINE>I have one question!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C6)
"Officer A...?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E0)
"Thousands of people just vanished! You saw it too, didn't you!?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F0)
"What are you talking about? Get out of here!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001100)
I was quickly losing confidence in my own memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000111A)
I decided to tell him about Makise Kurisu and get him<LINE>to call an ambulanc, but before I could--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001136)
"Look, I don't have time for your nonsense."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001146)
The policeman took me by the upper arm and said--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001156)
"No one got stabbed at Radio Kaikan."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001166)
What? How could he say that with such certainty?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001186)
While I was still trying to comprehend the siuation, the policeman<LINE>forcefully led us away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001196)
We were excorted up to UPX and released.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A6)
There were people at UPX, like usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B6)
Actually, there were far more people than usual. The place was packed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C6)
Just as Officer A had said, Chuo-dori had been blockaded by police,<LINE>so nobody could enter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001270)
There was nothing we could do, so we headed back to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001298)
And that brings us to the present.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A8)
I'm baffled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001310)
Did the whole hour since the beginning of Nakabachi's<LINE>presentation really happen?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001320)
I check online for any news.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001330)
The net is buzzing about the myserious machine that<LINE>crashed into Radio Kaikan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001340)
All of the major stations in Tokyo -- even ToTV -- <LINE>are running special bulletins about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000146E)
Fortunately, it doesn't look like anyone was hurt,<LINE>but Chuo-dori is till closed off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000147E)
Akihabara Station is jammed with reporters and curious onlookers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000148E)
Nobody has mentioned anything about the disappearance of thousands of people<LINE>from Akiba's streets, nor about Makise Kurisu's murder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000149E)
It's alla mystery.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014AE)
...A mystery?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C6)
"I see... so that's it!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D6)
From the sofa I spring to my feet, a wide grin on my face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001516)
Daru and Mayuri turn and stare.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001526)
"This is all an elaborate coverup by the Organization! Their influence has corrupted local<LINE>law enforcement, which means our entire gverment may already be under<LINE>their control. My god!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001536)
"but they underestimated me, for I am not so easily played.<LINE>One day I will expose their deeds and put an nd to thier reign!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015AC)
Having come to a satisfactory conclusion, I take a celebratory bottle of Dr P<LINE>-- my favorite soda -- from the fridge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C8)
The lab has no air conditioning. Ice cold drinks are essential.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D8)
"Ah, Elixir intellectualis, a drink fit for a genius!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F0)
"Cola's better."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001600)
"okarin really loves his Dr P!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001610)
"I pity the man who knows not hte freatness of this beverage!<LINE>Muhahaha!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001620)
Step through the curtain dividing its center, and you'll enter the<LINE>heart of the Future Gadget Laboratory: the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001630)
Just as the name implies, this is the room where we<LINE>develop Future Gadgets. Needless to say, it is strictly off-limits to outsiders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001696)
Yes, I know the setup is cheap -- I would much rather have<LINE>an airlock than a curtain -- but our research budget is already<LINE>scraping the bottom of the barrel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A6)
Besides, what's important isn't money. It's ambition.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B6)
I poke Daru and bid him follow me into the development room.
